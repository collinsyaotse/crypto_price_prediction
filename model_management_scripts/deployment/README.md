v# ML Model Deployment with FastAPI

This repository provides an example of deploying a machine learning model using **FastAPI** and **MLflow**. The model is a **regression model** trained using historical Bitcoin data and registered in MLflow. The FastAPI app exposes an API endpoint to make predictions using the trained model.

## Prerequisites

Before running the FastAPI app, make sure you have the following dependencies installed:

1. **FastAPI**: A modern, fast (high-performance) web framework for building APIs with Python.
2. **Uvicorn**: A fast ASGI server to run the FastAPI application.
3. **MLflow**: A platform for managing the ML lifecycle, including experimentation, reproducibility, and deployment.

You can install all the required dependencies using `pip`:

```bash
pip install fastapi uvicorn mlflow
